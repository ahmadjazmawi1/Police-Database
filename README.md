# Police-Database
Created a java program that simulates a police database. It stores many drivers, their vehicles, and any infractions they got

The driver class creates new drivers, and saves their drivers license number, city, province, and street address 

The vehicle class creates new vehicles and saves the license plate of the vehicle, make, model, color, a driver object (the owner), and whether or not it was reported stolen. 

The infractions class creates infractions and saves the owner of the vehicle who got an infraction, the price, and a description of what was done to recieve the infraction


The policeDataBase program creates many drivers and adds them to the array, while making sure the array doesnt become full.
